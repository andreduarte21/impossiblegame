# ImpossibleGame

First group project at <Academia de Código_>. Made with only 2 weeks of Java, this project had to be developed after classes and had a deadline of one week.


# Main Concept
Platform game based on Escape Rooms.
The aim of the game is to escape the room in which the game starts.
The game provides some clues regarding the escape, so pay attention!
Use the arrow keys to move around.
